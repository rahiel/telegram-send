# Usage

To send a message:
``` shell
telegram-send "hello, world"
```
There is a maximum message length of 4096 characters, larger messages will be
automatically split up into smaller ones and sent separately.

To send a message using Markdown or HTML formatting:
```shell
telegram-send --format markdown "Only the *bold* use _italics_"
telegram-send --format html "<pre>fixed-width messages</pre> are <i>also</i> supported"
```
For more information on supported formatting, see the [formatting documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options).

The `--pre` flag formats messages as fixed-width text:
``` shell
telegram-send --pre "monospace"
```

To send a message from stdin:
``` shell
printf 'With\nmultiple\nlines' | telegram-send --stdin
```
With this option you can send the output of any program.

To send a file (maximum file size of 50 MB):
``` shell
telegram-send --file document.pdf
```

To send an image with an optional caption (maximum file size of 10 MB):
``` shell
telegram-send --image photo.jpg --caption "The Moon at night"
```

Telegram-send integrates into your file manager (Thunar, Nautilus and Nemo):

# Install

Install telegram-send system-wide with pip:
``` shell
sudo -H pip3 install telegram-send
```

Or if you want to install it for a single user (recommended):
``` shell
pip3 install telegram-send
```

If installed for a single user you need to add `~/.local/bin` to their path,
refer to this [guide][] for instructions.

And finally configure it with `telegram-send --configure` if you want to send to
your account, `telegram-send --configure-group` to send to a group or with
`telegram-send --configure-channel` to send to a channel.

Use the `--config` option to use multiple configurations. For example to set up
sending to a channel in a non-default configuration: `telegram-send --config
channel.conf --configure-channel`. Then always specify the config file to use
it: `telegram-send --config channel.conf "hello"`.

# Examples

Here are some examples to get a taste of what is possible with telegram-send.

## Alert on completion of shell commands

Receive an alert when long-running commands finish with the `tg` alias, based on
Ubuntu's built-in `alert`. Put the following in your `~/.bashrc`:

``` shell
alias tg='telegram-send "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo "" || echo "error: ") $(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*tg$//'\'')"'
```

And then use it like `sleep 10; tg`. This will send you a message with the
completed command, in this case `sleep 10`.

What if you started a program and forgot to set the alert? Suspend the program
with Ctrl+Z and then enter `fg; telegram-send "your message here"`.

To automatically receive notifications for long running commands, use [ntfy][]
with the Telegram backend.

## Periodic messages with cron

We can combine telegram-send with [cron][] to periodically send messages. Here
we will set up a cron job to send the [Astronomy Picture of the Day][apod] to
the [astropod][] channel.

Create a bot by talking to the [BotFather][], create a public channel and add
your bot as administrator to the channel. You will need to explicitly search for
your bot's username when adding it. Then run `telegram-send --configure-channel
--config astropod.conf`. We will use the [apod.py][] script that gets the daily
picture and calls telegram-send to post it to the channel.

We create a cron job `/etc/cron.d/astropod` (as root) with the content:

``` shell
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
0 1 * * * telegram ~/apod.py --config ~/astropod.conf
```

Make sure the file ends with a newline. Cron will then execute the script every
day at 1:00 as the user `telegram`. Join the [astropod][] channel to see the
result.

## Supervisor process state notifications

[Supervisor][] controls and monitors processes. It can start processes at boot,
restart them if they fail and also report on their status. [Supervisor-alert][]
is a simple plugin for Supervisor that sends messages on process state updates
to an arbitrary program. Using it with telegram-send (by using the `--telegram`
option), you can receive notifications whenever one of your processes exits.

## Usage from Python

Because telegram-send is written in Python, you can use its functionality
directly from other Python programs: `import telegram_send`. Look at
the [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/telegram-send/api/).

## ASCII pictures

Combining `--stdin` and `--pre`, we can send ASCII pictures:

``` shell
ncal -bh | telegram-send --pre --stdin
apt-get moo | telegram-send --pre --stdin
```

# Questions & Answers

## How to use a proxy?

You can set a proxy with an environment variable:
``` shell
https_proxy=https://ip:port telegram-send "hello"
```

Within Python you can set the environment variable with:
``` python
os.environ["https_proxy"] = "https://ip:port"
```

If you have a SOCKS proxy, you need to install support for it:
``` python
pip3 install pysocks
```
If you installed `telegram-send` with `sudo`, you also need to install `pysocks`
with `sudo`.

# Uninstall

``` shell
sudo telegram-send --clean
sudo -H pip3 uninstall telegram-send
```

Or if you installed it for a single user:
``` shell
telegram-send --clean
pip3 uninstall telegram-send
```
